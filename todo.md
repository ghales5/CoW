# To-do

- Shapefiles for the different geographies
- Demographic tables
- Function to calculate centroid given inputs of lat/longs
  - Either use the actual lat/longs and calculate the geographic centre
  - Or aggregate up to a geography and then calculate the weighted centre of that (`wt.centroid` from SpatialEco might do this)
- Start to think about leaflet design
